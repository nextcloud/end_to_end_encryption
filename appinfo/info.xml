## **End-to-End Encryption**

### For End Users

**Protect your most sensitive files with strong encryption.**

The End-to-End Encryption app gives you complete control over your data privacy.
With this app, you can encrypt specific folders so that only you (and those you trust) can access their contents.
Your files are encrypted on your device before they reach the server, ensuring that no one—not even the server administrator—can read them.

**Benefits:**
- 🔒 **True privacy**: Files are encrypted on your device and can only be decrypted by you
- 📱 **Works across all platforms**: Fully supported on desktop, Android, iOS clients, and as you wish even in the browser
- 🎯 **Selective encryption**: Choose which folders to encrypt
- 🛡️ **Secure sharing**: Share encrypted files with other users or even secure public upload using the encrypted file drop

---

### For Administrators

**Enterprise-ready end-to-end encryption infrastructure for your Nextcloud instance.**

This app provides all the necessary server-side APIs and infrastructure to enable End-to-End encryption (E2EE) for your users.
It ensures that encrypted data remains secure throughout its lifecycle on your server.

**Technical highlights:**
- 🔐 **Complete API suite**: Provides all client-side APIs needed for E2EE implementation
- 🔒 **Secure FileDrop integration**: Enables secure file sharing with encryption
- 🛡️ **Zero-knowledge architecture**: Server never has access to encryption keys
- ⚙️ **Group restrictions**: Limit app usage to specific user groups if needed
- 🔄 **Background job management**: Automatic rollback handling for failed operations

### Setup
This application provides the server-side infrastructure for end-to-end encryption, but it requires client support to function.
To enable end-to-end encryption, users will need to install the corresponding client-side app on their devices (desktop, Android, iOS) or use the web client.

Using the web interface, after enabling it in the personal settings, allows you to encrypt files and folders directly in the browser,
providing a seamless experience without needing additional software. But also requires some kind of trust in the server as the code is delivered by the server and could be manipulated.

Once enable through clients or the web interface, you can create encrypted folders and upload or move files into them.
The clients and the web interface will handle the encryption and decryption processes automatically.

⚠️ This comes with some limitations and caveats, as only normal file operations can be handled.
Meaning that some apps in the web interface do not work with encrypted files.
